# My First React App - A Bulletin Board

In this repo, I have created a React App called Bulletin Board where user can add stciky notes to a web based board. I have followed the "Learning React.js" course by Eve Porcello on LinkedIn Learning to build this app. This repo cotains step by step implementation of the app spread through five chapters and the 6th chapter contains the final react app.<br>
