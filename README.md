# My First React App - A Bulletin Board

In this repo, I have created a React App called Bulletin Board where user can add sticky notes to a web App. I have followed the "Learning React.js" course by Eve Porcello on LinkedIn Learning to build this app. This repo contains step by step implementation of the app which is spreaded through five chapters/folders and the 6th chapter (Ch06) contains the final react app.<br>


## Getting started
1. Clone this repository and start terminal.
2. ```cd Ch06/06_02/start/bulletin-board```
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm install --save react-draggable```
5. ```npm start```
6. It will start the app on local host 3000 port.
7. Visit ```http://localhost:3000```
8. Use the ```+``` button to create a new note. App supports the editing, deleting and dragging of the note within the web browser.
